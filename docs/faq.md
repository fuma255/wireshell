> "What about aliases for commands?"

You can use aliases for each command. Here is an example:

Normal way:

```sh
$ wireshell field:create {name}
```

Using an alias, you can skip everything behind the first letter **if this is enough to identify the desired command**.

```sh
$ wireshell f:cr {name}
```

You can't use `$ wireshell f:c` for this command, because it's ambiguous (`field:create`, `field:clone`).
This will lead to an exception.

```sh
$ wireshell f:c {name}

 [InvalidArgumentException]
 Command "f:c" is ambiguous (field:create, field:clone).
```

> "I use MAMP PRO for Mac and get the error message 'Error: Exception: SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002]...'"

You got two possibilities here:

1. Allow network access to MAMP's MySQL: In MAMP 3's main window, go to the "MySQL" tab, and activate "Allow network access to MySQL" > From this computer. From then on you can swap localhost with 127 .0.0.1 in your local PW installations and wireshell will work.
2. [Solve it](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16688151) by changing to MAMP's mysql.sock.

> "I'm on Windows and either can not or wish not to put wireshell in my path, or have several PHP versions installed"

Instead of adding something to the path simply create a single `wireshell.bat` file and put it into your already existing system path.
